# Todos for initial release

- figure out what to change in package to ensure it can read custom propertygroup
- document analyzer and options on github
- TypesNotToDiscard.txt should be extended to support both types and methods - use standard syntax for it  instead.
- use explanation property if it is set.
- test everything with the nuget package
