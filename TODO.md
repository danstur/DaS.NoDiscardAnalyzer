# Todos for initial release

- figure out what to change in package to ensure it can read custom propertygroup
- good diagnostic messages!!
- document analyzer and options on github
- how to handle inheritance of types we should not discard?
    - when defined in aditional file
    - when attributing it (is it automatically inherited?)
- should we show a warning if no attribute is available?
    - yes: possibly usage error?
    - no: additionalfile can still be used => BUT in that case should still work!!
        => show warning if no file AND no attribute exists?
