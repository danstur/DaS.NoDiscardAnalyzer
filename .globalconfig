## StyleCop Changes

# CA1000: Do not declare static members on generic types
# While it can be confusing, it's still useful
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1000.severity = none

# CA1031: Do not catch general exception types. While generally a good idea
# there are situations where we do want to catch exceptions for e.g. logging purposes.
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1031.severity = none

# CA1062: Validate arguments of public methods:
# While a good idea for library code, in application code we just rely on NNRT and the compiler.
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1062.severity = none

# CA1063: Implement IDisposable correctly.
# Overkill for most use cases if no unmanaged resources and finalizers are involved
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1063.severity = none

# CA1303: Do not pass literals as localized parameters. We'll localize the necessary parts anyhow.
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1303.severity = none

# CA1711: Identifiers should not have incorrect suffix.
# We use Ex for static classes that extend framework classes, e.g. FileEx.
dotnet_code_quality.CA1711.allowed_suffixes = Ex

# CA1711: Using a reserved keyword as the name of a namespace makes it harder for consumers in other languages to use the namespace.
# We don't care here since we might use keyword for the cli.
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1716.severity = none

# CA1816: Call GC.SuppressFinalize correctly
# Only necessary for handling unmanaged resources directly when using a finalizer. Not something we're doing.
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1816.severity = none

## IDE Warnings

# IDE005: Remove unnecessary imports. Make sure we don't have any.
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0005.severity = error

# IDE0043: Format string contains invalid placeholder
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0043.severity = error
# IDE0051: Remove unused private member
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0051.severity = error
# IDE0052: Remove unread private member
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0052.severity = error
# IDE0063: Use simple 'using' statement. Simply a matter of taste, no reason to force anything.
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0063.severity = none
